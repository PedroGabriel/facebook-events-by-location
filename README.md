# Search Facebook events by location (as a service)
Based in tobilg - https://github.com/tobilg/facebook-events-by-location

A PHP-based webservice to get public Facebook events by location. It can be used as a starting point for an location-based app for example.

As Facebook has discontinued the FQL query API for all apps created after 2014-04-30, it has gotten much more complicated to get public Facebook events by passing a location.

This implementation uses regular Facebook Graph API calls in a three-step approach to get the events:

1. Search for places in the radius of the passed coordinate and distance (`/search?type=place&q=*&center={coordinate}&distance={distance}`)
2. Use the places to query for their events in parallel (`/?ids={id1},{id2},{id3},...`)
3. Unify, filter and sort the results from the parallel calls and return them to the client

###Known limitations

* The Graph API has some "instabilities" with search results. It's possible that the amount of results returned can vary between calls within seconds 
* Undocumented usage of the `q` parameter (`q=*` produced more results than `q=` or just omitting the `q` parameter)
* The `/search` endpoint "magically" limits the number of results, independent from the `distance` used (larger distance doesn't guarantee more results)
plications of host networking). 

##API
The basic endpoint is `index.php`, you should do the uri by your self at your service, like `/events`

###Query paramenters
Mandatory querystring are the following:

* `lat`: The latitude of the position/coordinate the events shall be returned for
* `lng`: The longitude of the position/coordinate the events shall be returned for
* `distance`: The distance in meters (it makes sense to use smaller distances, like max. 2500)
* `access_token`: The **App Access Token** to be used for the requests to the Graph API

Non-mandatory parameters

* `sort`: The results can be sorted by `time`, `distance`, `venue` or `popularity`. If omitted, the events will be returned in the order they were received from the Graph API

###Results
The response will be `application/json` and contain an `events` property containing the array of event objects, as well as a `metadata` property with some stats. See below for an example.

###Sample call

`http://localhost/index.php?lat=40.710803&lng=-73.964040&distance=1000&sort=venue&access_token=YOUR_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN` (make sure you replace `YOUR_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a real access token!)
